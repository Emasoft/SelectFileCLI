        ## Issues Found

        Most workflows use `sep_queue.sh` but never call `--queue-start`, meaning:
        - Commands are queued but never executed
        - No actual linting, testing, or validation happens
        - CI reports success without doing any work

        ## Recommendations

        1. Remove SEP from CI workflows
        2. Run commands directly (like build.yml)
        3. Add proper command execution tests
