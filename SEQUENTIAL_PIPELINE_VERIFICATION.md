# Sequential Pipeline Verification Report

## Architecture Understanding

### Two-Layer Architecture
1. **`wait_all.sh`** - Atomic Execution Unit
   - Executes a single command in isolated process group
   - Tracks ALL child processes and descendants
   - Monitors memory usage per process
   - Ensures complete cleanup before returning
   - Supports timeout, retry, and JSON output
   - Used internally by sequential_queue.sh

2. **`sequential_queue.sh`** - Queue Manager
   - Manages a queue of commands waiting to execute
   - Ensures only ONE command runs at a time (via lock mechanism)
   - Uses `wait_all.sh` internally to execute each command
   - Provides pipeline timeout for entire queue
   - Auto-detects git/make commands for special handling
   - Adds comprehensive logging

### Key Relationship
- `sequential_queue.sh` calls `wait_all.sh` internally (line 501)
- Users can call either script depending on needs:
  - Use `wait_all.sh` directly for simple atomic commands
  - Use `sequential_queue.sh` for complex pipelines and queue management

## Documentation Corrections Made

1. **Architecture Diagram**: Updated to show `sequential_queue.sh` as Queue Manager and `wait_all.sh` as Atomic Execution Unit

2. **Pre-commit Configuration Note**: Clarified that:
   - Both scripts can be used in pre-commit hooks
   - `sequential_queue.sh` is recommended for better queue management
   - The choice depends on complexity and logging needs

3. **Pre-commit Examples**: Updated all examples to use `sequential_queue.sh` consistently for better queue management

4. **Timeout Values**: Updated Makefile examples to use consistent extended timeouts (3600s for formatting, 7200s for building)

## Installation Verification

### Successful Tests
- ✅ `install_sequential.sh install` creates proper .env.development with extended timeouts
- ✅ `install_sequential.sh doctor` shows all dependencies and scripts working
- ✅ All scripts have version 3.0.0
- ✅ All symlinks properly created:
  - `seq` → `scripts/sequential_queue.sh` (in project root)
  - `git-safe.sh` → `sequential_queue.sh` (for backward compatibility)
  - `make-sequential.sh` → `sequential_queue.sh`
  - `sequential-executor.sh` → `sequential_queue.sh`
- ✅ Scripts pass shellcheck linting
- ✅ Help screens work for all scripts
- ✅ Basic functionality tested successfully

### Configuration Files
- `.env.development`: Correctly generated with TIMEOUT=86400, PIPELINE_TIMEOUT=86400
- `pyproject.toml`: pytest configuration added with workers=1 for sequential execution
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: All hooks use `sequential_queue.sh` for proper queuing

## Command-Line Options Verified

### sequential_queue.sh
- `--timeout SECONDS`: Command timeout (default: 86400)
- `--pipeline-timeout SEC`: Pipeline timeout (default: 86400)
- `--memory-limit MB`: Memory limit per process (default: 2048)
- `--log-dir PATH`: Custom log directory (default: PROJECT_ROOT/logs)
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output

### memory_monitor.sh
- `--pid PID`: Process ID to monitor (default: parent process)
- `--limit MB`: Memory limit in megabytes (default: 2048)
- `--interval SECONDS`: Check interval in seconds (default: 5)
- `--log-dir PATH`: Custom log directory (default: PROJECT_ROOT/logs)

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Queue Management**: Uses lock directory `/tmp/seq-exec-PROJECT_HASH/` with:
   - `executor.lock`: Directory-based lock (mkdir is atomic)
   - `queue.txt`: List of PIDs waiting in queue
   - `current.pid`: Currently executing PID
   - `pipeline_timeout.txt`: Pipeline start time and timeout

2. **Memory Monitoring**: `memory_monitor.sh` runs in background (not wrapped in wait_all.sh) to monitor the sequential_queue.sh process

3. **Auto-detection**: `sequential_queue.sh` detects git/make commands and applies special handling

## Conclusion

The sequential pipeline v3 is properly implemented with:
- Clear two-layer architecture (queue manager → atomic execution)
- Extended default timeouts (24 hours)
- Comprehensive CLI options for customization
- Proper installation and health check tools
- All documentation synchronized with implementation
