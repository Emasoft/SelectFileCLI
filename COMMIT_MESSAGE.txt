feat: replace cycling sort with modal dialog for file browser

Refactored the file browser's sorting interface from a cycling approach
(repeatedly pressing 's') to a modal dialog with radio button selection.
Users now press 'S' once to open a dialog showing all sort modes and
order options, improving discoverability and reducing keystrokes.

The implementation adds a new SortDialog class using Textual's ModalScreen,
provides visual feedback with radio buttons, and simplifies the footer to
show only essential commands. This change addresses user feedback about
the previous cycling interface being non-intuitive.

BREAKING CHANGE: Removed individual sort shortcuts (n/d/z/e/o). Users must
now access all sorting options through the unified sort dialog.

- Add SortDialog modal with RadioSet widgets for sort selection
- Support sort modes: Name, Creation, Accessed, Modified, Size, Extension  
- Show sort order with visual arrows (Ascending ↓ / Descending ↑)
- Fix CustomDirectoryTree to handle DirEntry objects correctly
- Remove cycling sort mode and individual keyboard shortcuts
- Update all 24 tests to work with new dialog-based interaction
- Achieve 80% test coverage (up from ~78%)
- Update version to 0.3.0 for this UI breaking change

Fixes: TypeError when DirectoryTree nodes contained DirEntry objects
Tests: All tests passing with updated SVG snapshots
