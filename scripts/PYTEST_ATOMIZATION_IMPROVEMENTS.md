# Pytest Atomization Improvements Summary

## Overview
The sequential queue system has been significantly enhanced with intelligent pytest test atomization and snapshot detection capabilities to prevent memory explosions and optimize test execution.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Correct Test Discovery and Execution
- **Before**: Used Python AST parsing and `-k` flag for test execution
- **After**: Uses `pytest --collect-only -q` for proper test discovery and `::` syntax for execution
- **Example**: `pytest tests/file.py::TestClass::test_method`

### 2. Intelligent Snapshot Detection
- **NEW**: Automatically detects which tests use snapshot comparisons
- Only applies `--snapshot-update` flag to tests that actually need it
- Regular tests run without unnecessary snapshot overhead
- Prevents accidental snapshot file modifications

### 3. Optimized Memory Usage
- Snapshot tests are batched in groups of 2 to prevent memory explosions
- Regular tests run individually for better isolation
- Memory usage reduced from 35GB+ to normal levels

### 4. Comprehensive Test Result Collection
- Automatically parses pytest output after each test
- Stores detailed results in JSON format
- Tracks PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED status for each test
- Aggregates results across all atomic test runs

## Implementation Components

### Scripts Created/Modified

1. **scripts/tool_atomifier.sh** (Enhanced)
   - Added intelligent snapshot detection
   - Improved test discovery using pytest's collection
   - Separate handling for snapshot vs regular tests

2. **scripts/detect_snapshot_tests.py** (New)
   - Python AST-based analysis to detect snapshot test usage
   - Returns JSON with categorized test lists
   - Identifies tests using `snap_compare`, `snapshot`, etc.

3. **scripts/parse_pytest_results.sh** (New)
   - Parses pytest output logs
   - Extracts individual test results
   - Generates JSON summary with statistics

4. **scripts/aggregate_test_results.sh** (New)
   - Aggregates results from multiple test runs
   - Provides overall pass rates and statistics
   - Lists failed tests with job IDs for debugging

5. **scripts/run_test_with_snapshot_detection.sh** (New)
   - Intelligent single-test runner
   - Auto-retries with `--snapshot-update` only for snapshot failures
   - Prevents unnecessary snapshot updates

6. **scripts/sequential_queue.sh** (Enhanced)
   - Added automatic pytest result parsing
   - Stores test statistics in job metadata
   - Links to detailed JSON results

## Usage Examples

### Basic Atomization
```bash
# Add atomized pytest command to queue
sequential_queue.sh --atomify pytest tests/test_file.py

# View how command will be atomized
scripts/tool_atomifier.sh pytest --snapshot-update tests/test_file.py
```

### Result Analysis
```bash
# View aggregated results from latest run
scripts/aggregate_test_results.sh

# List all runs with pytest jobs
scripts/aggregate_test_results.sh --list

# View specific run results
scripts/aggregate_test_results.sh run_20240106_123456
```

### Intelligent Test Execution
```bash
# Run single test with snapshot detection
scripts/run_test_with_snapshot_detection.sh tests/test_app.py::test_method
```

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents 35GB+ memory explosions by atomizing tests
2. **Intelligent Execution**: Only snapshot tests get `--snapshot-update`
3. **Better Debugging**: Individual test results tracked with detailed logs
4. **Performance**: Regular tests run faster without snapshot overhead
5. **Safety**: Prevents accidental snapshot modifications
6. **Visibility**: Comprehensive reporting of test results

## Example Output

### Atomization with Intelligent Detection
```
# Snapshot tests (batched with --snapshot-update):
ATOMIC:pytest --snapshot-update tests/file.py::test_snapshot1 tests/file.py::test_snapshot2
ATOMIC:pytest --snapshot-update tests/file.py::test_snapshot3

# Regular tests (individual, no --snapshot-update):
ATOMIC:pytest tests/file.py::test_regular1
ATOMIC:pytest tests/file.py::test_regular2
```
