# Robust Snapshot Detection Implementation

## Overview
The pytest atomization system now includes robust error handling and graceful degradation when dealing with projects that have no snapshot tests or when snapshot detection fails.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Graceful Error Handling
- **detect_snapshot_tests.py** always returns valid JSON, even on errors
- Handles non-existent files, empty files, and syntax errors gracefully
- Returns empty snapshot lists when detection fails

### 2. Safe Fallbacks
- If snapshot detection fails, all tests are treated as regular tests
- `--snapshot-update` flag is removed from ALL tests if no snapshots are detected
- System continues to work even without the Python detection script

### 3. Intelligent Flag Management
- When `--snapshot-update` is requested but NO snapshot tests exist:
  - The flag is automatically removed from all commands
  - Tests run individually without unnecessary overhead
  - No risk of accidental snapshot file creation

## Example Behaviors

### Project with No Snapshot Tests
```bash
# Input command:
pytest --snapshot-update /tmp/test_no_snapshots.py

# Output (--snapshot-update removed automatically):
ATOMIC:pytest /tmp/test_no_snapshots.py::test_addition
ATOMIC:pytest /tmp/test_no_snapshots.py::test_subtraction
```

### Detection Script Missing or Fails
```bash
# If detect_snapshot_tests.py is missing or fails:
# - Falls back to simple grep detection
# - Continues operation without interruption
# - Treats all tests as regular tests if uncertain
```

### Non-existent Test File
```bash
# Handles gracefully:
python3 detect_snapshot_tests.py /nonexistent.py
{
  "snapshot_tests": [],
  "all_tests": [],
  "file": "/nonexistent.py",
  "error": "File not found: /nonexistent.py"
}
```

## Safety Features

1. **No Crashes**: Script continues even if:
   - Snapshot detection fails
   - Python is unavailable
   - Test file is missing or malformed

2. **Conservative Behavior**: When uncertain, treats tests as regular (non-snapshot) tests

3. **Clear Debugging**: DEBUG mode shows when snapshot detection is skipped or fails

4. **Fallback Chain**:
   - Try Python AST detection
   - Fall back to grep pattern matching
   - Default to no snapshots if both fail

This ensures the atomization system works reliably across all projects, whether they use snapshot testing or not.
