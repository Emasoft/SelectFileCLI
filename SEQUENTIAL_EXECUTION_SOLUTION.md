# Sequential Execution Solution - Error-Proof Implementation

## Problem Statement
Multiple concurrent executions were bypassing the sequential pipeline, causing:
- 71+ shell processes running simultaneously
- Memory exhaustion risk
- Git operation conflicts
- System lockups

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Multiple Entry Points**: Direct `make` commands bypass sequential control
2. **Missing Memory Monitor**: Referenced but never implemented
3. **Concurrent Git Operations**: Multiple git processes cause deadlocks
4. **No Process Limits**: Runaway processes consume unlimited memory

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Memory Monitor (`scripts/memory_monitor.sh`)
- Monitors all child processes of sequential executor
- Kills processes exceeding memory limit (default 2GB)
- Prevents system lockup from runaway processes
- Features:
  - Process tree monitoring
  - Configurable memory limits
  - Graceful termination (SIGTERM) then force kill (SIGKILL)
  - Runs only during pre-commit and build processes

### 2. Make Sequential Wrapper (`scripts/make-sequential.sh`)
- Ensures only ONE make command runs at a time
- Project-specific locks using hash of project path
- Queue management for waiting commands
- Features:
  - Atomic lock acquisition using mkdir
  - Stale lock detection and cleanup
  - Visual queue position feedback
  - 5-minute timeout for stuck locks

### 3. Sequential Executor Enhancements
- Integrated memory monitor startup
- Git operation conflict detection
- Special handling for concurrent git commands
- Waits up to 10 seconds for git operations to complete

### 4. Safe Execution Chain
```
make command → make-sequential.sh → wait_all.sh → sequential-executor.sh → actual command
                    ↓                                         ↓
                Global Lock                            Memory Monitor
```

## How It Works

### Preventing Concurrent Make Commands
1. User runs `make test` and `make lint` simultaneously
2. First command acquires global make lock via `make-sequential.sh`
3. Second command queues and waits for lock
4. Only one `make` command executes at a time

### Memory Protection
1. Sequential executor starts memory monitor as background process
2. Monitor checks all child processes every 5 seconds
3. Warns when process uses >1GB (50% of limit)
4. Kills process tree if >2GB used
5. Monitor exits when parent process completes

### Git Operation Safety
1. Sequential executor detects git commands
2. Checks for other running git operations
3. Waits up to 10 seconds for completion
4. Prevents git index corruption

## Usage

### For Developers
```bash
# All make commands are now safe
make test
make lint
make format

# Multiple commands queue automatically
make test & make lint & make format
# Only one runs at a time

# Emergency cleanup
make kill-all
```

### Configuration
```bash
# Set memory limit (MB)
export MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=4096

# Set check interval (seconds)
export CHECK_INTERVAL=10

# Set command timeout (seconds)
export TIMEOUT=3600
```

## Verification

### Check Running Processes
```bash
# See sequential processes
ps aux | grep -E "(sequential-executor|wait_all|make-sequential|memory_monitor)"

# Check queue
cat /tmp/seq-exec-*/queue.txt

# Monitor locks
ls -la /tmp/seq-exec-*/
ls -la /tmp/make-lock-*/
```

### Test the System
```bash
# Should queue properly
for i in {1..5}; do make test & done

# Watch the queue
watch -n 1 'cat /tmp/seq-exec-*/queue.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "Empty"'
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Process Explosions**: Strict sequential execution
2. **Memory Safety**: Automatic killing of runaway processes
3. **Git Operation Safety**: Prevents index corruption
4. **Developer Friendly**: Transparent queuing with feedback
5. **Self-Healing**: Automatic cleanup of stale locks and orphans

## Implementation Details

### Lock Mechanisms
- **Make Lock**: `/tmp/make-lock-${PROJECT_HASH}/`
- **Sequential Lock**: `/tmp/seq-exec-${PROJECT_HASH}/executor.lock`
- Both use `mkdir` for atomic operations

### Process Tree Management
- Recursively finds all child processes
- Kills in reverse order (children first)
- Uses SIGTERM for graceful shutdown
- Falls back to SIGKILL if needed

### Queue Management
- FIFO queue in `/tmp/seq-exec-${PROJECT_HASH}/queue.txt`
- Format: `PID:TIMESTAMP:COMMAND`
- Automatic cleanup on process exit

## Troubleshooting

### Stale Locks
```bash
# Remove all locks for current project
PROJECT_HASH=$(pwd | shasum | cut -d' ' -f1 | head -c 8)
rm -rf /tmp/seq-exec-${PROJECT_HASH}/
rm -rf /tmp/make-lock-${PROJECT_HASH}/
```

### High Memory Usage
```bash
# Check current memory usage
ps aux | sort -nrk 4 | head -10

# Adjust memory limit
export MEMORY_LIMIT_MB=8192
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output
export VERBOSE=1
make test
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Metrics Collection**: Track queue wait times, memory peaks
2. **Priority Queue**: Allow high-priority commands to jump queue
3. **Distributed Locking**: Support for CI/CD environments
4. **Resource Pools**: CPU and I/O limiting in addition to memory

## Conclusion

This solution provides bulletproof protection against:
- Process explosions from concurrent executions
- Memory exhaustion from runaway processes
- Git corruption from simultaneous operations
- System lockups from resource exhaustion

The implementation is transparent to developers while providing robust safety guarantees.
