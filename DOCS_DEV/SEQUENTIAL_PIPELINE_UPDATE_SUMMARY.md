# Sequential Pipeline Update Summary

## Date: 2025-07-06

### What Was Updated

The `SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md` has been created as a comprehensive, self-sufficient recipe for setting up the sequential pipeline v3 from scratch in any uv-managed Python project. This replaces the previous v2 protocol with enhanced features and fixes.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. wait_all.sh v3.2 Integration
- Updated from v3.1 to v3.2 with parent process protection
- Added helper functions `is_protected_pid()` and `is_protected_pgid()`
- Enhanced process discovery with recursive `find_descendants()`
- Fixed exit code propagation through proper ERR trap handling
- Improved NUL-separated value parsing for reliability

#### 2. AI Subagent Coordination Rules
Added comprehensive rules to prevent conflicts when using AI agents:
- Sequential execution only (one subagent per task type)
- Exclusive resource access patterns
- Task specialization requirements
- Resource locking order to prevent deadlocks
- Clear examples of good vs bad subagent patterns

#### 3. Tool Configurations
Added complete configurations for:
- **Python tools**: pyproject.toml with ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage, isort, black
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Comprehensive .pre-commit-config.yaml with all essential hooks
- **Tool installation**: Complete commands for uv, pnpm, brew, and go tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Example CI workflow with uv integration

#### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- Prerequisites now include all essential tools
- Bash version requirements clarified (3.2+ for wait_all.sh, 4.0+ for sequential-executor.sh)
- Security notes for TruffleHog v3 and environment variables
- Quick reference expanded with common tool commands

### Tools Covered

The guide now includes configurations for:
- pre-commit, uv, uv-pre-commit
- ruff, mypy, shellcheck, yamllint, eslint, yamlfmt
- trufflehog, jq, jsonlint, actionlint, gh
- pytest, pytest-cov, pnpm, act, prettier
- commitizen, npx, bfg, packaging, pluggy
- pygments, watchdog, pytest-watcher, syrupy
- pytest-asyncio, colorama, coverage, ruff-pre-commit
- docformatter, nbqa, isort, sqlfluff, pyupgrade
- pytest-sugar, pytest-mock, hypothesis, mkdocs
- commitizen, cz-conventional-gitmoji, deptry

### File Location
The complete guide is now at: `SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md`

### Usage
This document serves as a complete recipe that can be followed step-by-step to set up the sequential pipeline in any project, ensuring:
- No process explosions
- Memory limit enforcement
- Proper git operation serialization
- Pre-commit hook safety
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Parent process protection (v3.2 feature)
- Correct exit code propagation (v3.2 fix)

The guide is self-sufficient and includes all scripts, configurations, and setup instructions needed for a bulletproof development environment.

### Protocol Version
This is **Sequential Pipeline Protocol v3**, which supersedes v2 with the following improvements:
- wait_all.sh v3.2 with parent process protection
- Enhanced process tracking and cleanup
- Fixed exit code propagation
- AI subagent coordination rules
- Complete tool configuration templates
