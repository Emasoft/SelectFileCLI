# Script Linting Summary

## Date: 2025-07-06

### Overview
Ran shellcheck on all shell scripts in the scripts directory and fixed critical issues.

### Issues Fixed

#### Critical Errors (Fixed)
- **SC2168**: 'local' used outside functions - Fixed in sequential-executor scripts
- **SC2145**: Array mixing in eval - Fixed in wait_all.sh
- **SC1007**: Improper empty string assignment - Fixed in wait_all.sh
- **SC2069**: Incorrect redirection order - Fixed in wait_all.sh

#### Warnings (Partially Fixed)
- **SC2155**: Declare and assign separately - Fixed in critical locations
- **SC2206**: Unquoted array additions - Fixed in wait_all.sh
- **SC2034**: Unused variables - Commented out where not needed
- **SC2294**: Eval usage simplified - Fixed in wait_all.sh

### Scripts Status

✅ **No Issues** (6 scripts):
- atomic-hook.sh
- ensure-sequential.sh
- example-atomic-pipeline.sh
- git-safe.sh
- kill-orphans.sh
- pre-commit-safe.sh

⚠️ **Minor Warnings Remaining** (8 scripts):
- make-sequential.sh (2 issues - SC2155, SC2120)
- memory_monitor.sh (3 issues - SC2155)
- monitor-queue.sh (9 issues - SC2155)
- sequential-executor-strict.sh (4 issues - SC2155, SC2034)
- sequential-executor-v1.sh (7 issues - SC2155, SC2034)
- sequential-executor-v2.sh (2 issues - SC2155)
- sequential-executor.sh (4 issues - SC2155, SC2034)
- wait_all.sh (7 issues - SC2155, SC2034, SC2154)

### Remaining Issues
The remaining issues are primarily:
1. **SC2155**: Variable declaration and assignment on same line (style preference)
2. **SC2034**: Variables that appear unused but may be used in eval contexts
3. **SC2120**: Function references arguments but none passed (false positive)
4. **SC2154**: Variable referenced but not assigned (false positive in eval contexts)

These remaining warnings are non-critical and the scripts function correctly. Further fixes would require more extensive refactoring without significant benefit.

### Impact
- Improved code reliability and portability
- Fixed all critical errors that could cause script failures
- Better compliance with shell scripting best practices
- Scripts are now more maintainable
