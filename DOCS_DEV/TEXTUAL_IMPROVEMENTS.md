# Textual Framework Best Practices Analysis for SelectFileCLI

Based on the official Textual documentation, here's an analysis of the current implementation and recommendations for improvements:

## Current Implementation Strengths âœ…

1. **Proper App Class Extension**: `FileBrowserApp(App[Optional[FileInfo]])` correctly extends the App class with a return type.

2. **CSS Organization**: Uses inline CSS which is acceptable for small applications.

3. **Binding Definitions**: Properly uses the `BINDINGS` list with clear key mappings.

4. **Compose Method**: Correctly implements `compose()` to yield widgets.

5. **Worker Pattern**: Uses `@work` decorator for async operations, following Textual's recommended pattern.

## Recommendations for Improvement ðŸ”§

### 1. **Consider External CSS File**
While inline CSS works, for better maintainability consider:
```python
CSS_PATH = "file_browser.tcss"  # Move CSS to external file
```

### 2. **Use App Class Variables for Configuration**
```python
class FileBrowserApp(App[Optional[FileInfo]]):
    TITLE = "Select File Browser"  # Use class variable instead of setting in __init__
    CSS_PATH = "file_browser.tcss"
```

### 3. **Leverage Built-in Actions**
The current implementation has custom quit action. Consider using Textual's built-in:
```python
def action_quit(self) -> None:
    """Override the built-in quit action."""
    self.exit(self.selected_item)  # Current implementation is correct
```

### 4. **Screen Management**
For complex navigation states, consider using Screens:
```python
SCREENS = {
    "browse": BrowseScreen,
    "sort": SortScreen,
}
```

### 5. **Mode Management**
For different browsing modes:
```python
MODES = {
    "files": "browse",
    "folders": "browse",
    "both": "browse",
}
```

### 6. **Async Best Practices**
Current worker implementation is good, but ensure:
- Workers are properly cancelled on exit
- Use `call_from_thread()` if calling from background threads

### 7. **Testing Considerations**
- Current modal dialog (SortDialog) is well-structured for testing
- Consider using `App.run_test()` for unit tests

### 8. **Performance Optimizations**
- Current LRU cache implementation is good
- Consider using `@lru_cache` decorator from functools for simpler caching

### 9. **Event Handling**
Current implementation correctly uses:
- `on_mount()` for initialization
- `@on()` decorator for widget events
- Action methods for key bindings

### 10. **Theme Support**
Consider adding theme awareness:
```python
def on_theme_change(self) -> None:
    """React to theme changes."""
    # Update any theme-dependent styles
```

## Code Quality Observations

1. **Type Annotations**: Excellent use throughout âœ…
2. **Docstrings**: Well-documented methods âœ…
3. **Error Handling**: Good try/except blocks âœ…
4. **Separation of Concerns**: CustomDirectoryTree separates tree logic âœ…

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Add Suspend Support**
```python
def action_suspend(self) -> None:
    """Suspend to shell."""
    self.suspend()
```

2. **Command Palette Integration**
The app could benefit from command palette for advanced features.

3. **Reactive Attributes**
Consider using more reactive attributes for state management:
```python
current_path = reactive(Path.cwd())
```

4. **Signal Usage**
For decoupled communication between components:
```python
path_changed = Signal[Path]()
```

## Conclusion

The SelectFileCLI implementation follows most Textual best practices. The main areas for improvement are:
- Moving CSS to external file for larger applications
- Using class variables for static configuration
- Considering Screens for more complex UI states
- Adding theme support

The current implementation is solid and production-ready, with good async handling, proper event management, and clean separation of concerns.
