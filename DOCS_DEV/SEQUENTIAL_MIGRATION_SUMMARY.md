# Sequential Pipeline Migration Summary

## Overview

The SelectFileCLI project has been successfully migrated to the updated sequential execution protocol as specified in `SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md`. This ensures that only ONE process runs at a time, preventing process explosions and memory exhaustion.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core Scripts (in `scripts/` directory)

- **`wait_all.sh`**: Core script that executes commands and waits for EVERY descendant process to complete
- **`sequential-executor.sh`**: Enforces single-process execution with orphan management
- **`safe-run.sh`**: Wrapper that delegates to sequential-executor using wait_all.sh
- **`seq`**: Short alias for quick sequential execution
- **`ensure-sequential.sh`**: Setup verification script
- **`monitor-queue.sh`**: Real-time queue monitoring tool

### 2. Configuration Files Updated

- **`.env.development`**: Environment variables for resource limits
- **`pytest.ini`**: Sequential execution settings for tests
- **`tests/conftest.py`**: pytest hooks to enforce sequential execution
- **`tests/test_utils.py`**: Sequential subprocess utilities for tests
- **`Makefile`**: Safe command wrappers using sequential execution
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: All hooks use `require_serial: true`
- **`.github/workflows/sequential-ci.yml`**: CI pipeline with sequential execution

### 3. Key Changes from Old Protocol

1. **No more `exec` commands**: Everything uses `wait_all.sh` for proper process completion
2. **Consistent lock directory**: Uses project hash for unique identification
3. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on Linux, macOS, and BSD
4. **Better orphan detection**: Combined patterns for efficiency
5. **Robust path resolution**: Handles various path configurations

## Usage Guide

### Running Commands Sequentially

```bash
# Using make commands (recommended)
make test
make lint
make format

# Using the seq wrapper
./scripts/seq uv run pytest
./scripts/seq python script.py

# Using safe-run.sh
./scripts/safe-run.sh uv build
```

### Monitoring Execution

```bash
# In a separate terminal
make monitor

# Or directly
./scripts/monitor-queue.sh
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Source environment variables
source .env.development

# Run setup verification
./scripts/ensure-sequential.sh
```

### Command Aliases

```bash
# Enable command interception
source .sequential-aliases

# Now all commands automatically use sequential execution
pytest  # Actually runs: sequential-executor.sh uv run pytest
python  # Actually runs: sequential-executor.sh python
```

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER use `&` for background execution**
2. **NEVER run pytest with `-n auto` or `-n >1`**
3. **ALWAYS use make commands or `./scripts/seq` wrapper**
4. **ALWAYS wait for commands to complete**

## Testing the Setup

Run the test script to verify sequential execution:

```bash
./test_sequential.sh
```

This demonstrates that commands wait for each other and execute one at a time.

## Emergency Commands

If processes get stuck:

```bash
# Kill all processes and clear locks
make kill-all

# Or manually
rm -rf /tmp/seq-exec-*
pkill -f sequential-executor.sh
pkill -f pytest
```

## Verification Checklist

✅ All scripts created and executable
✅ Environment configuration in place
✅ pytest configured for sequential execution
✅ Pre-commit hooks use `require_serial: true`
✅ Makefile with safe commands
✅ CI pipeline configured for sequential execution
✅ No `exec` commands in scripts (except wait_all.sh)
✅ Test utilities for sequential subprocess execution

## Benefits

1. **Prevents process explosions**: Only one process runs at a time
2. **Memory safety**: Prevents memory exhaustion from parallel processes
3. **Orphan management**: Automatically detects and kills orphaned processes
4. **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and BSD systems
5. **Complete integration**: All tools (pytest, pre-commit, CI) use the system

## Migration Complete

The sequential pipeline is now fully operational. All development commands should be run through the safe wrappers to ensure resource safety and prevent system overload.
