# Atomic Command Update Summary

## Overview
Updated all scripts and documentation to enforce the atomic command principle where wait_all.sh is the atomic link of the sequential chain. Each command processes the smallest possible unit of work to minimize memory usage and enable precise failure isolation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Script Updates

#### wait_all.sh v3.1
- Added `-E` flag to `set -Eeuo pipefail` for ERR trap inheritance
- Ensures complete subprocess cleanup before exit
- Prevents memory leaks from orphaned processes

#### git-safe.sh
- Fixed to use wait_all.sh directly for atomic execution
- Removed double-chaining through sequential-executor.sh
- Changed from:
  ```bash
  "$WAIT_ALL" -- "$SEQUENTIAL_EXECUTOR" git "$@"
  ```
  To:
  ```bash
  "$WAIT_ALL" -- git "$@"
  ```

#### safe-run.sh
- Fixed to delegate directly to sequential-executor.sh
- Removed unnecessary wait_all.sh wrapper
- Sequential-executor.sh handles wait_all.sh internally

#### ensure-sequential.sh
- Updated pre-commit hook to call sequential-executor.sh directly
- Removed double-chaining with wait_all.sh

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP 2.md
- Replaced sequential-executor.sh source with current strict version
- Added comprehensive atomic command principle section
- Updated all examples to show atomic vs non-atomic patterns
- Verified pre-commit config uses atomic commands
- Verified Makefile examples use atomic commands

#### SEQUENTIAL_EXECUTION_PHILOSOPHY.md
- Added atomic operations principles:
  - Smallest unit of work
  - File-level granularity
  - Process files individually, not in batches

### 3. Atomic Command Patterns

#### ❌ WRONG - Large batch operations:
```bash
wait_all.sh -- pytest tests/              # Runs ALL tests in one process
wait_all.sh -- ruff check src/            # Checks ALL files at once
wait_all.sh -- ruff format .              # Formats entire codebase
```

#### ✅ CORRECT - Atomic operations:
```bash
# Test each file individually
wait_all.sh -- pytest tests/test_file1.py
wait_all.sh -- pytest tests/test_file2.py

# Lint each file individually
wait_all.sh -- ruff check src/main.py
wait_all.sh -- ruff check src/module1.py

# Format each file individually
wait_all.sh -- ruff format src/main.py
wait_all.sh -- ruff format src/module1.py
```

## Architecture Summary

```
User Command
    ↓
Makefile / Direct Call
    ↓
safe-run.sh / make-sequential.sh
    ↓
sequential-executor.sh (enforces one-at-a-time)
    ↓
wait_all.sh (atomic execution with full cleanup)
    ↓
Actual Command (smallest unit of work)
```

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Each atomic command uses minimal memory
2. **Precise Failure Isolation**: Know exactly which file failed
3. **Complete Cleanup**: -E flag ensures no orphaned processes
4. **True Sequential**: Only one atomic operation at a time
5. **Pipeline Safety**: Entire chain protected by pipeline timeout

## Verification

All scripts now properly implement the atomic command principle:
- ✅ wait_all.sh v3.1 with -E flag for complete error handling
- ✅ Scripts use wait_all.sh as the atomic building block
- ✅ No double-chaining or redundant wrapping
- ✅ Documentation updated with current sources
- ✅ Examples show proper atomic patterns
