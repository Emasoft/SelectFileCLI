# Sequential Pipeline v3 Document Streamlining Summary

## Date: 2025-07-06

### What Changed

The SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md document was restructured to improve maintainability and readability:

1. **File Size Reduction**: 86KB â†’ 34KB (60% reduction)
2. **Script Extraction**: All embedded scripts removed and referenced as external files
3. **Improved Structure**: Scripts now referenced with features and download links

### Before
- Document contained full source code for 11 scripts inline
- Difficult to edit due to size (caused truncation issues)
- Scripts duplicated between document and scripts folder

### After
- Scripts stored only in `./scripts/` directory
- Document references scripts with:
  - Feature lists
  - Download links
  - Brief descriptions
- All configurations remain in document (they're smaller)

### Benefits
1. **Easier Maintenance**: Can update scripts without editing large document
2. **No Truncation**: Document is now small enough to edit completely
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Scripts exist in one place only
4. **Better Readability**: Focus on setup instructions, not implementation

### Structure Preserved
All original sections remain:
- Prerequisites and setup instructions
- Configuration files (pyproject.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, etc.)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Docker configuration
- Usage examples and troubleshooting
- AI Agent coordination rules

### Scripts Directory
The following scripts should be available in `./scripts/`:
- wait_all.sh (v3.2)
- sequential-executor.sh
- memory_monitor.sh
- git-safe.sh
- make-sequential.sh
- monitor-queue.sh
- kill-orphans.sh
- pre-commit-safe.sh
- atomic-hook.sh
- example-atomic-pipeline.sh
- ensure-sequential.sh

This streamlining makes the Sequential Pipeline Protocol v3 more maintainable while preserving all functionality and documentation.
