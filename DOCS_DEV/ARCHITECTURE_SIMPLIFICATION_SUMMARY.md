# Architecture Simplification Summary

## Overview
Removed unnecessary wrapper scripts (`seq` and `safe-run.sh`) to simplify the sequential pipeline architecture.

## Scripts Removed

### 1. `seq` Script
- **Problem**: Double-chaining through wait_all.sh → sequential-executor.sh → wait_all.sh
- **Solution**: Use wait_all.sh or sequential-executor.sh directly
- **Replacement**: `./scripts/wait_all.sh -- <command>`

### 2. `safe-run.sh` Script
- **Problem**: Only delegated to sequential-executor.sh without adding value
- **Solution**: Call sequential-executor.sh directly when needed
- **Replacement**: `./scripts/sequential-executor.sh <command>`

## Simplified Architecture

### Before (Complex):
```
User Command
    ↓
seq or safe-run.sh
    ↓
wait_all.sh (unnecessary layer)
    ↓
sequential-executor.sh
    ↓
wait_all.sh
    ↓
Actual Command
```

### After (Simple):
```
User Command
    ↓
wait_all.sh --    OR    sequential-executor.sh
    ↓                           ↓
Actual Command            wait_all.sh --
                               ↓
                          Actual Command
```

## Usage Patterns

### 1. For Atomic Execution (parallel allowed, complete cleanup guaranteed):
```bash
./scripts/wait_all.sh -- python script.py
./scripts/wait_all.sh -- pytest tests/test_file.py
./scripts/wait_all.sh -- ruff format src/main.py
```

### 2. For Sequential Locking (only one at a time):
```bash
./scripts/sequential-executor.sh pre-commit
./scripts/sequential-executor.sh make test
```

### 3. In Makefile (already sequential via make-sequential.sh):
```makefile
WAIT_ALL := ./scripts/wait_all.sh

test:
    @$(WAIT_ALL) -- uv run pytest -v

format:
    @$(WAIT_ALL) -- uv run ruff format src tests
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Scripts Updated:
- **Makefile**: Changed from SAFE_RUN to WAIT_ALL
- **pre-commit-safe.sh**: Now calls sequential-executor.sh directly
- **ensure-sequential.sh**: Removed checks for safe-run.sh

### 2. Documentation Updated:
- **SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP 2.md**:
  - Removed sections 2.4 (safe-run.sh) and 2.5 (seq)
  - Renumbered all subsequent sections
  - Updated all usage examples
  - Fixed script directory listing

### 3. Files Deleted:
- `/scripts/seq`
- `/scripts/safe-run.sh`

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Architecture**: Direct usage makes it obvious what's happening
2. **Less Confusion**: No redundant scripts doing the same thing
3. **Better Performance**: Removed unnecessary process layers
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer scripts to maintain and document

## When to Use What

- **wait_all.sh**: Default choice for atomic operations
- **sequential-executor.sh**: When you need queue management and sequential locking
- **Direct commands**: When you don't need process cleanup guarantees

The simplified architecture maintains all the safety features while being easier to understand and use.
