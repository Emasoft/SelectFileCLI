- [x] sequential-executor.sh (strict version)
- [x] memory_monitor.sh
- [x] safe-run.sh (corrected version)
- [x] seq (shorthand wrapper)
- [x] git-safe.sh (full version with atomic execution)
- [x] make-sequential.sh

- [x] Memory protection
- [x] Process cleanup
- [x] Deadlock prevention

## ✅ Verification & Testing
- [x] Verification steps
- [x] Test commands
- [x] Queue monitoring
- [x] Troubleshooting section

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Script Corrections Made:
- **safe-run.sh**: Fixed to delegate directly to sequential-executor.sh (no double wait_all.sh)
- **git-safe.sh**: Updated to use wait_all.sh directly for atomic execution
- **sequential-executor.sh**: Replaced with current strict version

### 2. Scripts Added:
- pre-commit-safe.sh
- atomic-hook.sh
- example-atomic-pipeline.sh
- ensure-sequential.sh

## ✅ Document Self-Sufficiency

The document is now **COMPLETE and SELF-SUFFICIENT** for setting up a sequential pipeline from scratch in any project. It includes:

1. **All necessary scripts** with full source code
2. **Clear setup instructions** with both quick and detailed options
3. **Configuration templates** for all required files
4. **Usage examples** demonstrating atomic command patterns
5. **Verification steps** to ensure proper setup

## Usage Instructions

To use this document in a new project:

1. Copy the entire document to your project
2. Follow the "Quick Setup" section for rapid deployment
3. Or follow the detailed step-by-step instructions
4. Run `./scripts/ensure-sequential.sh` to verify setup
5. Use `make` commands or `./scripts/seq` for sequential execution

The document provides everything needed to implement a production-ready sequential execution pipeline that prevents process explosions and memory exhaustion.
