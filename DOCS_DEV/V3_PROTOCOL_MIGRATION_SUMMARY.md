### Usage

To implement the Sequential Pipeline Protocol v3 in any project:

1. Copy `SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md` from this project
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions
3. All scripts and configurations are included inline
4. The guide is completely self-sufficient

This completes the migration to Protocol v3, which supersedes v2 with enhanced safety, reliability, and comprehensive tool support.
