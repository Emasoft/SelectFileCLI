# Requirements Verification Report

## Summary

This report verifies all 11 requirements from the GitHub issues for the selectFileCLI project.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Requirement Tests (`test_requirements_verification.py`)
- **Purpose**: Programmatically verify each requirement works correctly
- **Coverage**: All 11 requirements have dedicated test functions

### 2. Visual Snapshot Tests (`test_visual_requirements.py`)
- **Purpose**: Visually verify UI layout and appearance
- **Coverage**: 9 visual tests covering different layouts and states

### 3. Edge Case Tests (`test_edge_case_snapshots.py`)
- **Purpose**: Test extreme conditions and Unicode support
- **Coverage**: 16 edge case scenarios including terminal resizing

## Requirements Status

| # | Requirement | Description | Test Status | Notes |

| 8 | Column Alignment | Directory entries are column-aligned | âœ… PASS | Files aligned with size and date |
| 9 | Cancel Performance | Cancel is fast and returns None values | âœ… PASS | Quick exit with FileInfo(all None) |
| 10 | Error Messages | Error message field works correctly | âœ… PASS | FileInfo.error_message populated |
| 11 | Terminal Resizing | Real-time resizing works | âœ… PASS | UI adapts to different sizes |

## Test Files Created

### Core Test Files
1. **`test_requirements_verification.py`** (15 tests)
   - Comprehensive programmatic tests for all requirements
   - Tests actual functionality and behavior
   - Includes edge cases and error conditions

2. **`test_visual_requirements.py`** (10 tests)
   - Visual snapshot tests for UI verification
   - Tests different terminal sizes
   - Verifies layout and appearance

### Snapshot Apps
1. **`test_empty_folder.py`** - Tests empty folder placeholder display
2. **`test_aligned_files.py`** - Tests file alignment with various lengths
3. **`test_error_state.py`** - Tests error display scenarios

## Key Findings

### âœ… All Requirements Verified
- All 11 requirements have been successfully implemented
- Tests confirm correct behavior in normal and edge cases
- Visual snapshots ensure consistent UI appearance

### ðŸ“Š Coverage Improvements
- New tests increased coverage of file_browser_app.py
- Error handling paths now tested
- Edge cases for Unicode and special characters covered

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Consistency
- Layout remains stable across terminal sizes (30x10 to 200x40)
- Unicode characters display correctly
- No overlapping UI elements

## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Testing**: Run these tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Snapshot Updates**: Update visual snapshots when UI changes
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Consider adding performance benchmarks
4. **Accessibility**: Future tests could verify keyboard navigation completeness

## Conclusion

All 11 requirements from the GitHub issues have been successfully implemented and verified through comprehensive testing. The file browser is robust, handles edge cases well, and provides a consistent user experience across different terminal configurations.
