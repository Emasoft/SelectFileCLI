# Script Consolidation Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Scripts Integrity and Fixes
- Removed duplicate `SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md` from scripts folder
- Fixed shellcheck error in `sequential_queue.sh` (removed `local` outside function)
- Fixed `monitor-queue.sh` reference to use `sequential_queue.sh` instead of old `sequential-executor.sh`
- Fixed `memory_monitor.sh` help screen error by deferring log file creation

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Options
All scripts now support customizable timeouts and log directories:

**sequential_queue.sh**:
- Added `--timeout SECONDS` (default: 86400)
- Added `--pipeline-timeout SEC` (default: 86400)
- Added `--memory-limit MB` (default: 2048)
- Added `--log-dir PATH` (default: PROJECT_ROOT/logs)
- Added `--verbose` flag

**memory_monitor.sh**:
- Added `--log-dir PATH` option for custom log directory

### 3. Extended Default Timeouts
Per user request, all default timeouts were extended to very long durations:
- Command timeout: 1800s → 86400s (24 hours)
- Pipeline timeout: 7200s → 86400s (24 hours)
- Pre-commit hook timeouts: Various short timeouts → 1800s-7200s

### 4. Pre-commit Configuration Updates
**CRITICAL CHANGE**: All pre-commit hooks now use `sequential_queue.sh` instead of `wait_all.sh` to ensure proper queuing:
- `ruff-format-atomic`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 3600s timeout
- `ruff-check-atomic`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 3600s timeout
- `deptry`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 7200s timeout
- `mypy-safe`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 7200s timeout
- `trufflehog-safe`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 3600s timeout
- `yamlfmt`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 1800s timeout
- `yamllint`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 1800s timeout
- `actionlint`: Now uses sequential_queue.sh with 1800s timeout

### 5. Documentation Updates
Updated `DOCS_DEV/SEQUENTIAL_PRECOMMIT_SETUP_v3.md` with:
- New "Recent Updates (v3.0.0)" section documenting all changes
- Updated command-line options for sequential_queue.sh and memory_monitor.sh
- Added usage examples with new options
- Added important note about using sequential_queue.sh in pre-commit hooks
- Updated all timeout values in examples
- Updated .env.development template with new timeout values

### 6. GitHub Actions Updates
Updated `sequential-ci.yml` workflow:
- TIMEOUT_SECONDS: 600 → 86400
- TRUFFLEHOG_TIMEOUT: 300 → 3600
- timeout-minutes: 60 → 1440 (24 hours)

### 7. Installation Script Updates
Updated `install_sequential.sh`:
- Default timeout values in .env.development template now 86400s

## Key Points for Users

1. **Use sequential_queue.sh for everything**: This is the main entry point for sequential execution. It auto-detects git and make commands.

2. **Extended timeouts**: All operations now have very long default timeouts (24 hours) to prevent premature termination.

3. **Custom log directories**: Use `--log-dir` option to specify where logs should be saved.

4. **Pre-commit hooks are properly sequential**: All hooks now go through the queue system to prevent concurrent execution.

## Testing Results
- All scripts pass shellcheck linting
- Help screens work for all scripts
- Basic functionality tested successfully
- Scripts properly handle stale locks and timeouts

## Next Steps
1. Run `./scripts/install_sequential.sh install` to set up the environment
2. Run `./scripts/install_sequential.sh doctor` to verify installation
3. Test pre-commit hooks with actual commits
4. Monitor logs in PROJECT_ROOT/logs/ for any issues
